# SDL Circle
SDL Circle rendering.

## Building
Building is currently done with [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/), [vcpkg](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg), and BASH.

Run `./build.sh` to kick off the build.
After the building is complete, a local directory will be created with the output.
You should be able to see a `main` executable in a new `build/` directory in the project directory if the build were successful.

## Running
Run with `./build/main`
